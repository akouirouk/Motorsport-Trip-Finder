# Motorsport Trip Finder

## Inspiration

I love traveling, and even more so, I love motorsport.

So the inspiration for this project came naturally. After planning several trips for myself and my family over the years, I started to dread doing all of the reserach to see which events will be in or around my destination, or sometimes not even having a destination in mind and trying to find cool motorsport events happening around the world that may interest me. Then, looking for the best prices for airfare and accomodation, seeing what the weather will be during the stay (I don't like having to pack thick jackets), and everything else that comes with planning a trip - it sometimes took the spark of excitement I had for heading out on this expedition.

I wanted something that I can feed my trip desires and do all the work for me, then show me my options.

After sitting on this idea for a couple years, I finally decided actually start development on it one day, sitting inside my favorite coffee shop. Aren't coffee shops great?!?!

This will be an ongoing project that will be kept open-source, and I hope that some of you avid motorsport fans (or aspiring motorsport fans!) can make some use out of this.

## How To Use It

Will write a detailed instructions manual on usage once the MVP is complete.

## How Does It Work

As the codebase grows and development progresses, I will continue to update this section.
